**What Did I Do This Week?**

This week my partner and I starting working on our last project, Life.  At first glance, the project seems very similar to Darwin.  The board, multiple classes, and way the game is played are all so similar that often times we would reference our project 4 code when working on this project.  However, inheritance and abstract classes make the project more complex.  Right now we have most of the base code written, and we are focused on finishing the project as soon as possible in order to have enough time to document and submit this project.  I am looking forward to being done with all of my OOP projects!

**What Is In My Way?**

This past week was less strenuous than normal, in large part to no major tests or projects being due that week.  This week, however, is more stressful as I have one midterm in addition to life being due on Thursday.  I am feeling pretty good about class except for some of the quiz questions from lecture.  It seems like I have lots of trouble with the constructor questions that Professor Downing asks frequently.  I hope that the final is similar to the midterm in the sense that there will be lots of writing code in C++.  I did well on the midterm so if the final is similar I should do well in this class. 

**What Will I Do Next Week?**

Next week will be spent finishing Life and looking forward to the final and end of the semester.  I have enjoyed this class and have learned a lot this semester.  Coming in with zero experience in C++, this class has helped me greatly in terms of learning the language and learning other useful tools that are applicable in real software development.

**Tip of the Week**

It's good every once in a while to change where you study and program.  Too often I find myself locked in my room or the lab for hours working on a project.  I find coffee shops to be a very relaxing enviornment to code.
