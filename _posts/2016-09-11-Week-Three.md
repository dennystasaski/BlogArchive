**What Did I Do This Week?**

This week the main thing on my mind was finished our first project, Collatz.  The project ended up being both easier and harder than I was expecting.  For one, the actually programming part of the project was very straightforward.  I probably only spend about 2 or 3 hours solving the problem and implementing a cache.  The rest of the project took significantly more time.  All the tools and overhead required to submit the project seemed excessive and were time consuming.  However, I believe once I get better at all of the tools like Docker and Travis this amount of overhead time will be much less.

**What Is In My Way?**

Right now I am having trouble understanding some of the pointer/reference concepts Professor Downing went over in class.  A lot of the more advanced examples are not very clear to me.  I will have to work through some examples on my own to fully understand the concept. 

**What Will I Do Next Week?**

Since we just finished a project, I get a little breathing room for this class.  Although I still have to keep up with the class and study, I have more time to focus on others classes (especially since I have my first test on Tuesday).  Overall, this class has already taught me some fundamentals to C++.  I am completely new to the language but I feel like I am getting a good grasp on it.

**Tip of the Week**

I was looking for Git tutorials online and I found a neat, comprehensive website: [http://learngitbranching.js.org/](http://learngitbranching.js.org/)
