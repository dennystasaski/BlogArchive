**What Did I Do This Week?**

This week I spent most of the time looking over notes and reviewing lectures in order to prepare for our first exam.  It's nice not having a project due this week, but I know that is because of our upcoming exam.  It kind of feels like the calm before the storm- there are no approaching deadlines but I know that if I do not adequately prepare for this I will be in a whirl of trouble.

**What Is In My Way?**

Right now I feel overwhelmed because of the post Professor Downing made on Piazza about the first test.  Knowing that most of the first test will be over C++ worries me because I am new to the language.  There are so many methods, operators, and tricks that I need to learn to be successful on the test.  However, we get one page of notes so that makes me feel a little better.  I hope that I can do well on the test despite my inexperience in the language- I don't want the only people getting A's to be the people that already know C++.

**What Will I Do Next Week?**

Study, study, study.  In addition to our first exam, I have others tests and projects that are piling up in my other classes.  I will have to kiss goodbye to free-time this week and start making sacrifices for my grades.  I hope my schedule doesn't get any crazier than it already is because I am really feeling the pressure.

My experience in the class has been good so far.  Professor Downing seems knowledgable and gives us useful information that we can apply outside of this class.  I also enjoy the guest speakers that he invites.  Hearing how they are applying their Computer Science knowledge to the outside world gives me a nice prospective on what my life will be like post-graduation.

**Tip of the Week**

Study way ahead of time for exams.  If you don't carve out time in your schedule now, you will feel rushed at the last minute.  Even though our exam is on Thursday I know I will be taking time out of every day this week to prepare.
