**Overall Class Experience**

As I look back on this class as a whole, I feel much different than I expected at the beginning of the semester.  I expected this class to be very highly focused on OOP concepts with a little bit of programming to help solitify the lectures.  And while we did learn lots of object oriented concepts, the real value in the class for me was the enviornment Professor Downing created for the class.  Things like prioritizing discussion, collaboration, and software tools that are used by real developers helped me grow as a programmer and Computer Scientist.  Much of the class was focused on getting us ready to graduate and encounter a wide variety of challanges, which I now feel much more prepared to face.  In addition to software tools, I found that writing this blog helped me throughout the class by forcing myself to look at the big picture and stay on task.  Also, it was pretty neat reading other people's blogs and looking at their experience in the class.  

A big challenge for me going into this class was my lack of C++ experience.  Before this semester, I had never looked at or written code in C++.  This class served as an excellent starting point for learning C++ as the projects were challenging but not overly difficult.  It helped a lot that Professor Downing used Java as the base OOP language that he would compare to C++.  This made it easy to learn, and coupled with his experience in teaching, made the class very enjoyable.  Overall, I learned a great deal in this class and would highly recommend it to others.  I truly feel like I learned a lot and I feel better prepared going into the workforce in a couple years.
