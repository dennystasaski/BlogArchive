**What Did I Do This Week?**

This week was spent finishing our fourth project, Darwin.  This project was the first that was noticably harder on the coding side than all of our other projects.  This took me and my partner by surprise.  We still finished all of the coding part of the project but we had some trouble finishing all of the unit tests.  It seems crazy to me that we need to write an average of three tests per private method, since the number of private methods depends heavly on your particular implementation.  I know that we should be writing tests as we are programming, but sometimes that just isn't possible when we use a private methods to do very small things that we know are completely correct.  

**What Is In My Way?**

Right now I need to make sure that I am attending as many lectures as possible.  I have already missed a few lectures for interviews and on top of that I have done bad on a chunk of the quizzes.  Therefore I need to plan any future interviews/events around the lecture time so that I can attend all the remaining lectures.  Hopefully then the only bad grades I have will be dropped.  Other than that, I just need to stay focused through the end of the semester.  

**What Will I Do Next Week?**

Other than starting our final project, Life, I need to look forward and start reviewing my notes and studying for the final.  I assume the final will be like the midterm where we just write C++ code.  I am feeling fairly confident right now because I did well on the last midterm.  However, that does not mean that I am going to lighten my workload.  Starting this week I am going to look back on previous notes and quizzes to relearn all the concepts.  

**Tip of the Week**

Every semester, the CS department puts on a one hour session where some professors from upper-level CS classes pitch their class.  I have found that to be incredibly helpful for deciding what class to take next semester.  Unfortunately it has already happened this semester, but keep an eye out for it in the coming semesters.
