**What Did I Do This Week?**

This week my partner Lan and I started working on our third programming project.  This is the first time I am working with a partner in this class, and honestly, I am not sure why I didn't do this earlier.  It is much easier to motivate each other to get stuff done and we work much faster together.  On top of that, we get five bonus points added to our project score.  I can see why Professor Downing puts emphasis on pair programming- it is much more efficient.

**What Is In My Way?**

Right now I am focused on trying to find enough time to finish project 3.  My partner and I both have very busy schedules and often times it takes days before we can work with each other again.  I guess that is one of the downsides to working with a partner.  However, whenever we do get a chance to work together we end up getting a lot done in a compact amount of time.

**What Will I Do Next Week?**

Next week I plan on finishing project three and keeping afloat as the work for my classes piles up.  Right now I am not fully focused on this class because I have midterms in other classes at the moment.  I felt confident leaving the first exam a couple of weeks ago and I hope that I do well on these projects so that I leave the class with a good understanding of the material and a good grade to demonstrate that.

**Tip of the Week**

Right now is prime interview season, and as I go out of town twice this month for interviews it is important to keep in mind what really matters.  It may be worth missing a class or two (even at the expense of your grade) to get a shot at an internship that may turn into a full time offer.
