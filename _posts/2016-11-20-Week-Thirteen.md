**What Did I Do This Week?**

This week most of my time was spent working on our last project, Life.  The entire project seemed very similar to Darwin, although there were some additions in complexity (such as inheritance).  The project took a bit longer than I thought to finish, but once I was done I was glad to have finally finished all of the projects for this class.  Overall, I thought the projects in this class was very helpful to learning C++.  Although if I could change them I would make the actual coding part a little more difficult and tone back the amount of time spent on all the extra tools and tests.  

**What Is In My Way?**

In order to feel like I was successful in this class, I need to do as well on this next exam as I did on the first midterm.  This won't be easy of course.  I need to get a study group together and start early so that this test will be easy.  I felt like my notes really helped me get through the first exam, so a good chunk of my time should be spent devoted to making that.


**What Will I Do Next Week?**

Right now I need to make sure that I set aside time over the break to study for the exam.  I often get distracted when I am at home and end up not studying as much as I should.  

**Tip of the Week**

Don't get distracted as we get close to the end of the semester.  Finish strong so that you are proud of the work you did over the semester.
